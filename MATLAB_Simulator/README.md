# KUKA LWR 4+ Matlab Simulator

Matlab Simulator of a KUKA LWR 4+ through the use of .urdf file

## Dynamics and Kinematics

In the folders _Dynamics_ and _Kinematics_ are stored all the useful functions needed for dealing with dynamics and kinematics of a KUKA LWR.

## Simulation

1. _LWR_sim.m_ is the main file 
2. _parameters.m_ is the file where initializing all the parameters needed fot the simulations
3. _robot_plot.m_ gives the 3D representation of the motion of the robot
